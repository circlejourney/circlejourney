Hi, Iâ€™m circlejourney! I'm a self-taught web developer. Most of my projects are on my [website](https://circlejourney.net/interactive), though I'm in the process of transferring the more complete projects here.

# Skills

- **Geolocation and working with ArcGIS datasets**: it's my research interest!

- **Python**: web scraping, automated wiki management and Discord bots
- Basic experience with MySQL database management (I mainly used it to maintain [my webcomic database](https://light.circlejourney.net))
