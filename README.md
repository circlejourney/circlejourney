Hi, Iâ€™m @circlejourney! 
- I'm a self-taught web developer who learns things  by jumping in the deep end.
- Currently I'm doing PhD research about participatory maps and locative media.
- I made the [Toyhouse code editor](https://github.com/circlejourney/theditor), among other things! I'll migrate them here bit by bit.

# To-do
- Toyhouse code editor (PHP, HTML, JS)
- Spectral Engine (GPS visual novel engine, HTML, JS)
