Hi, Iâ€™m @circlejourney! 
- I'm a self-taught web developer who learns things by jumping in the deep end.
- Currently I'm doing PhD research about locative media and how people create places together online.
- I made the [Toyhouse code editor](https://github.com/circlejourney/theditor), among other things! I'll upload them here bit by bit.

# Project highlights
- [Toyhouse live code editor](https://github.com/circlejourney/theditor)
- [Image Wall engine](https://github.com/circlejourney/imagewall)

# To-do
- Spectral Engine (GPS visual novel engine, HTML, JS)
