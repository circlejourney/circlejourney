Hi, Iâ€™m circlejourney! I'm a self-taught web developer who makes a bunch of web things. There's lots on my [website](https://circlejourney.net/interactive), I'm in the process of transferring the more complete projects here, bit by bit.

- Geolocation and mapping tools (it's my research interest!)
